# Anime Dubbing Society
It is a fundub studio site. I would like to use django for the backend and figma for design. This site should include: 
* A catalogue of ongoing and already finished anime
* An ability to add/remove an anime from watchlist
* An ability to rate the anime you have watched and a display window that shows an anime's rating by the site's users
* An ability to create an account and to see a list of anime you have already watched
